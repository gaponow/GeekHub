At the middle of my studying i decided that profession of accountant most likely isn't mine.
So at the moment i'm trying to find myself in web-development cause its great and i like it.
Hope it'll be my job and hobby at the same time :)
Also i'm highly energetic and motivated person and I love to work as a member or a leader of a team.
I am talkative and sociable but also known for getting "in the zone" while concentrating on detailed work.
So that's all. It was a demo version. To see full content - just wait for my graduation ;)</b></i></pre>
